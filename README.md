# Skin Cancer Classification

This repo is a Python implementation with Pytorch for skin cancer classification. This repo implements a simple machine learning pipeline where we acquire training and test data from Google Drive, build dataloaders, train deep learning models, and perform metric analysis.

## Installation

Please install Anaconda. Use the following comands to create a new environment for this work:

```bash
conda create -n tristar python=3.11
conda activate tristar
```

This implementation requires python>=3.11, as well as pytorch>=2.0.1 with cuda=11.8 and torchvision>=0.15.2. Please install PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies properly via [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
